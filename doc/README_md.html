<p>In this project, students will build upon the code in this repo to create a <a href="Pet.html"><code>Pet</code></a> Adoption Platform. Users will be able to apply to adopt pets, and Admins will be able to approve or reject applications and see statistics for the Shelters, Pets, and Applications in the system.</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Build out CRUD functionality for a many to many relationship</p>
</li><li>
<p>Use ActiveRecord to write queries that join multiple tables of data together</p>
</li><li>
<p>Use MVC to organize code effectively, limiting the amount of logic included in views and controllers</p>
</li><li>
<p>Validate models and handle sad paths for invalid data input</p>
</li><li>
<p>Use flash messages to give feedback to the user</p>
</li><li>
<p>Use partials in views</p>
</li><li>
<p>Use <code>within</code> blocks in tests</p>

A gem that enhances testing effectiveness is implemented (orderly, factorybot, faker, etc).

Some routes and actions are not restful, and student cannot defend those decisions.

Some instances where ActiveRecord helpers are not utilized. Some queries not accurately implemented. | Feature test coverage between 90% and 98%, or model test coverage below 100%, or tests are not meaningfully written or have an unclear objective, or tests do not utilize within blocks | GitHub Project board is not utilized during one of the checkins.

<p>Before your evaluation, choose 2 user stories to present. Try to pick user stories that you think will deliever the highest value in terms of feedback from the instructor.</p>

<p>During the evaluation, you will present your user story:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Demonstrate the user story on Heroku (or localhost if the feature is not functional in Production)</p>
</li><li>
<p>Show the test(s) for the user story</p>

Deploy your application to Heroku

As a visitor of the site
I will perform all user stories
By visiting the application on Heroku.
Localhost is fine for development, but
the application must be hosted on Heroku.

Use these guides: https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-rails5</pre>
